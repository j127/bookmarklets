Bookmarklets
============

Some bookmarklets.

If changing the code, run :code:`npm install`, then :code:`gulp build`. Then look in the build directory. The current bookmarks are there already.

* TODO: add buttons to this page for easy drag-and-drop into the browser.
* TODO: figure out how to stop uglify from turning :code:`(function () {})()` into :code:`!function () {}()`. It causes a redirect to a page that says *true*.
